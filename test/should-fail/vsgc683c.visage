 * Regression test: VSGC-683: Use Visage type name rather than Java type names in error messages

 *     found   : Integer
 *     required: vsgc683c.Node
 *     var n:Node = 1;

 *     var n:Node = 1;

 * There doesn't seem to be a way to provide .EXPECTED files 
 * for tests that are expected to fail compilation.
