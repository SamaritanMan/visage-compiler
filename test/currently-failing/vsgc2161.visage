/*
 * @test
 * This should be a run test with no output, or it needs a "PASS" output in EXEPECTED file.
 *
 * This bug has two parts, the need for a warning and the bug itself:
 * vsgc-2166: This should also at least generate a possible loss of precision warning.
 * vsgc-2167 is the bug part of 2161: "need to fix translation of INT*=NUMBER"
