JavaFX compiler milestone 1

Demonstrated:
 - module-level variables with explicit Integer and String type declaration
 - calling System.out.println()
 - calculating simple arithmetic expressions

Restrictions:
 - No type inference assumed.  All variables are given an explicit type.
 - Only types used are Integer and String
 - Module-level code is moved into an instance run() method, which should be static.
 - Instance run() method needlessly instantiates another instance.
