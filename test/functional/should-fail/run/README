For those not closely following 'dev' discussions and the commit logs...

To remove problems with inconsistent semantics, initialization problems,
and visibility problems for variables ('var' and 'def') at the
script-level (top-level) of a script, new rules and functionality have
been added --

The new normal-form of script places the main-code (the code to be run
when/if the script is explicitly invoked) into a run function:

    function run(__ARGS__: String[]) : java.lang.Object {
         //.. main-code here
    }

Which, if the command line arguments are not needed can simply be written:

    function run() {
         //.. main-code here
    }

But since we want to keep the ability to just start typing expressions
into a text window, there will be a simple-form where no run function is
given.  The simple-form will simply be to place the code to be run at
the script level -- as is done now.  This simple-form is disallowed if
the script is externally accessible, that is, if any of the script-level
members have access modifiers ('public', 'package', 'public-readable').

Casual and beginning users have no change in their usage.  While
component writers can still make their scripts executable (for testing etc).
