Visage compiler feature test #2

Demonstrated:
 - unidirectional binding of module-level variables to expressions containing module-level variables
 - binding to expressions that contain static functions
 - type of module-level variables inferred from initializer
 - interpolating arithmetic expressions into string literals

Restrictions:
 - bindings do not know about dynamic dependencies within functions, only static dependencies
 - excessive manual boxing and unboxing in binding expressions and location access
