/**
 * regression test: fix for one of the bugs in VSGC-175. The isssue is that the synthetic
 * class of a local ObjLit was generated at the top of the enclosing class and there was 
 * no access to any subsequent locall var declarations. This is for the case when the 
 * ObjLit is in onInsert, onReplace, etc methods of the Sequence modifications.
