Building the JavaFX Script Compiler

The JavaFX Script compiler requires Java 5 or 6 and Apache Ant 1.7.  

Because of diagnostic checks we are running during this early stage of the 
compiler's development, it requires more memory than Ant's default maximum.
This test will be disabled and the compiler's memory requirements will
lessen when as the project gets closer to release.  

Apache Ant loads options either from environment variables or option files,
as described here: http://ant.apache.org/manual/running.html#files.  Currently
the build compiles with ANT_OPTS set to -Xmx384m, but lower settings may work
on systems with less memory.

The "ant -projecthelp" command displays the various build targets available.
Here are some of the more commonly used ones:

Build the compiler:          ant
Build the runtime library:   ant runtime  OR  cd runtime; ant
Build and test everything:   ant all
Delete build artifacts:      ant clean
