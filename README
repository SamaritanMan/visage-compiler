Building the JavaFX Script Compiler

The JavaFX Script compiler requires Java 5 or 6 and Apache Ant 1.7.  

The "ant -projecthelp" command displays the various build targets available.
Here are some of the more commonly used ones:

Build the compiler:           ant
Build the runtime library:    ant runtime  OR  cd runtime; ant
Populate 'dist' directory:    ant dist
Build and test everything:    ant all
Delete build artifacts:       ant clean
Run test/regress/jfxc2347.fx: ant test-single -Dtest.fx.includes='**/jfxc2347.fx'

Please file any bugs using our JIRA issue tracking system:

NOTE:  when the project is first checked-out, the NetBeans IDE will report 
"unresolved library" warnings.  These warnings are resolved when building
the project for the first time, as the necessary external libraries are
copied from their respective project sites into this project directory.
