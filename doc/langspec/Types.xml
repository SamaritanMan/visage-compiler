<section><title>The void type</title>
<para>
The <code>void</code> type is a special type that has no values.
(Aside: An alternative would be to view <code>void</code> that only
a single value, <code>null</code>, the zero-length sequence.
That is more flexible, but it seems more useful to be able
to have a compile-error when assigning a void expression to a variable, say.)
Semantically, a statement is essentially an expression whose
type is void.  (Syntactically it may not be quite that.  ???)

<section><title>The unreachable type</title>
<para>
The <code>unreachable</code> type is a special type used for
an expression that never returns a value to its encloding expression.
For example, a <nonterminal def="#syntax.ReturnExpression">ReturnExpression</nonterminal> has type <code>unreachable</code> because execution continues
at the surrounding function's call-site.</para>
