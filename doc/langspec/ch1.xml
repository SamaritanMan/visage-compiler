<chapter id="overview"><title>Language Overview</title>

<para>
This chapter provides an overview of the <trademark>JavaFX</trademark> Script programming language. It describes -- at a high level -- its main features, saving detailed coverage of specific constructs for subsequent chapters. This book is intended for designers and developers of rich Internet client applications and elements, which run in web pages, as <trademark>Java</trademark> Web Start software, or as traditional desktop applications. It assumes the reader to be familiar with JavaScript and/or the <trademark>Java</trademark> programming language. While this book does not define a formal language specification, it can be considered a complete reference for all currently supported language features. </para>

<para>
The JavaFX Script programming language:
</para>


   <itemizedlist>

     <listitem> Uses a declarative syntax for specifying Graphical User Interface (GUI) components, allowing a developer's code to closely match the actual layout of the GUI.</listitem>

    
    <listitem>  Uses declarative data binding and incremental evaluation, making it possible to easily create and configure individual components. Application data and GUI components are automatically synchronized.</listitem>
    

    
    <listitem>  Is statically typed, having most of the same code structuring, reuse, and encapsulation features that make it possible to create and maintain very large programs in the Java programming language.</listitem>
    

    
    <listitem>  Works with all major IDEs, including the NetBeans IDE, the reference implementation IDE for software development with the Java programming language.</listitem>
    

    
    <listitem>  Is capable of supporting GUIs of any size or complexity.</listitem>
    
    

    <listitem>  Makes it easier to use Swing.</listitem>

</itemizedlist>


<para>

The following sections present a whirlwind tour of the JavaFX Script programming language.
They provide a general introduction to its core syntax and capabilities, comparing and contrasting to the Java 
programming language where appropriate. Each topic is then covered in 
 greater  detail in subsequent chapters.</para>


<sect2 id="classintro"><title>Classes</title>

<para>Class definitions share many similarities with the Java programming language, but there are differences as well. 
State, for example, is information stored in <emphasis>attributes</emphasis>, not variables. Behavior is exposed through <emphasis>functions</emphasis>, not methods. The following 
example defines a simple <code>Rectangle</code> class that demonstrates the basic syntax of each. </para>

<programlisting>

class Rectangle {

     attribute width: Integer;
     attribute height: Integer;

     function grow(): Void {
          width++;
          height++;
     }

     function grow(amount: Integer): Void {
          width += amount;
          height += amount;
     }

}
</programlisting>

<para>Unlike the Java programming language, class definitions are not required for scripts that 
simply use existing libraries. Additionally, the JavaFX Script programming language supports <emphasis>multiple inheritance</emphasis>, making it possible to inherit from 
more than one class if desired.
</para>


<para>
Classes are covered in detail in Chapter 2,

</para>


<para>
Attributes and Functions are covered in detail in Chapter 3,

<emphasis><ulink
    url="functions.html">Attributes and Functions</ulink></emphasis>.

</para>


</sect2>


<sect2 id="objectliteral"><title> Objects</title>


<para><emphasis>Object literals</emphasis> provide a simple syntax for class instantiation.
The following code creates a single instance of the <code>Rectangle</code> class defined above, initializing its 
<code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes to <code>100</code> 
(note that <code>new</code> is not needed.) </para>

<programlisting>

Rectangle {

     width: 100
     height 100

}</programlisting>


<para>
To store a reference to this object, use the <code>var</code> keyword:
</para>


<programlisting>
var myRect = Rectangle {
     
     width: 100
     height 100
}</programlisting>


<para>
Objects are covered in detail in Chapter 2,

<para>Variables and basic data types are covered in detail in Chapter 4, 
<emphasis><ulink

</sect2>

<sect2 id="statements"><title>Expressions, Statements, and Operators</title>

<para>All programming languages have support for expressions, statements, and 
operators; the JavaFX Script programming language is no different. However, 
unlike the Java programming language, the JavaFX Script programming language 
is an <emphasis>expression language</emphasis>, which means that all executable statements -- inluding conditionals, loops, and even blocks -- are expressions.</para>


<para>
Chapter 5,  

<emphasis><ulink
    url="expressions.html">Expressions, Statements and Operators</ulink></emphasis>, 

discusses the expressions, statements, and operators available in the JavaFX Script programming language. 
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="seq"><title>Sequences</title>

<para>A <emphasis>sequence</emphasis> holds an ordered list of objects. 
This is roughly analogous to Java programming language arrays; 
 both hold multiple values and are accessed by index starting at 0.</para>

<programlisting>

var week = ["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday",
                  "Friday","Saturday","Sunday"];
var mon = week[0];
var wed = week[2];
var fri = week[4];
</programlisting>


<para>
Sequence <emphasis>slices</emphasis> are also supported:
</para>

<programlisting>

var week = ["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday",
                  "Friday","Saturday","Sunday"];
var weekdays = week[0..4]; // first slice
var weekend = week[5..6]; // second slice
</programlisting>

<para><emphasis>Chapter 6</emphasis>


<emphasis><ulink
    url="sequences.html">Sequences</ulink></emphasis>
    
    
    covers the basics of declaring sequences, while <emphasis>Chapter 7</emphasis>, 
    
    <emphasis><ulink
    url="comprehensions.html">Sequence Comprehensions</ulink></emphasis>,
    
    
    focuses on the supported <emphasis>sequence comprehension</emphasis> specifiers. 
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="databinding"><title>Data Binding</title>


<para><emphasis>Data binding</emphasis> 
  provides a simple syntax for synchronizing the state of multiple objects. 
When two objects are <emphasis>bound</emphasis> to one another, the second object's value automatically changes whenever the 
first object is updated. A common use of data binding is to keep GUI components synchronized with 
their underlying data.</para>

<programlisting>

<!-- **** <FONT COLOR="RED">TO-DO: Change package to javafx.gui</FONT> *** -->

import javafx.ui.Frame;
import javafx.ui.Button;

var myString = "Click Me";

Frame {
     width: 50
     height: 50
     visible: true
     content:
          Button {
               text: bind myString
          }

}

// If some other part of code changes myString
// then the Button's text will automatically change
// as well.
</programlisting>


<para>
Data Binding is covered in detail in Chapter 8,

</para>

</sect2>


<sect2 id="triggerintro"><title>Triggers</title>

<para><emphasis>Triggers</emphasis> are blocks of code that run when certain conditions are true. 
For example, you may want to take action 
 to guard against an attribute's value being set to something that is inappropriate.
The following example shows the basic trigger syntax:</para>

<programlisting>
import java.lang.System;

ReplaceDemo {
     
     mySensitiveData: "Will anyone notice?"

}

class ReplaceDemo {
     attribute mySensitiveData: String
          on replace/programlisting> {
               System.out.println("I noticed a change!");                      
          };

          // application-specific safeguarding code would go here 
}

</programlisting>

<para>Triggers are covered in detail in Chapter 9,
