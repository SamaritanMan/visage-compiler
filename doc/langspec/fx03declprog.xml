<title>Declarative Programming</title>
<sect1 id="declare"><title>Declarative Programming Overview</title>

<para>
<emphasis>Declarative programming is a new topic for many readers. We need to explain how JavaFX Script relates to Java and how Declarative Programming simplifies this relationship. </emphasis>
</para>



<sect2 id="dquestions"><title>Questions</title>
<para>
<emphasis>A chapter on Declarative programming should probably describe how JavaFX Script calls into the JRE to access Java classes, and which classes it can access. </emphasis></para>

<para>
<emphasis>Can JavaFX Script and Java code be mixed in the same scipt? How? Under what conditions? How does it work? </emphasis></para>

<para>
<emphasis>We probably need a block diagram that shows how the JavaFX Script product ties into its wrapper libraries to access Java Swing classes in the JRE via JavaPlayer.  </emphasis></para>

<para>
<emphasis>How do I put a JavaFX sript into a browser?  How do I put a JavaFX Script on my local desktop as a stand-alone application? How do I write a JavaFX applet? </emphasis></para>

<para>
<emphasis>Can JavaFX Script instantiate a Java class? Yes; and we need to explain how and when we do this; and how JavaFX accesses the JRE) </emphasis></para>

<para>
<emphasis>Can Java instantiate a JavaFX Script class? (I don't know, but I imagine it is possible. When would we do this?  My general question:  Can we mix JavaFX and Java source in the same file? How? Why? </emphasis></para>
