This directory contains JDI implementation for JavaFX.

How to build/test fxjdi.jar?

* make sure that you set JAVA_HOME pointing to JDK6. FX-JDI uses JDK 6
JDI interface and so requires JDK 6 to build and run.

* make sure that you build compiler repo (by running "ant" in parent dir.

* run "ant jar" or "ant" (builds and tests fxjdi.jar) in this directory.

How to run command line FX-JDI debugger?

In addition to a JDI implementation, there is also a command line debugger
like "jdb". This implementation is derived from jdb implementation except 
that this one uses FX-JDI connectors by default.

To run command line debugger on Mac OS, you can use

    java -jar fxjdi.jar <java-main-class>

or to use JavaFX target programs:

    java -jar fxjdi.jar -classpath <path-of-visagert.jar>  \
        com.sun.visage.runtime.Main <visage-module-class>

On Windows and Linux, you can use the following commands:

    java -cp <path-of-tools.jar>:fxjdi.jar com.sun.visage.tools.debug.tty.TTY \
        <java-main-class>

or to use JavaFX target programs:

    java -cp <path-of-tools.jar>:fxjdi.jar com.sun.visage.tools.debug.tty.TTY \
        -classpath <path-of-visagert.jar> com.sun.visage.runtime.Main \
        <visage-module-class>

Notes on FX-JDI implementation:
    
* FX-JDI connectors are in com.sun.visage.jdi.connect package.

* com.sun.visage.jdi, .event, .request packages have classes implementing
interfaces of com.sun.jdi, com.sun.jdi.event, com.sun.jdi.request respectively.

* FX-JDI implementing classes delegate to underlying platform JDI objects.
The wrapping/unwrapping is primarily done in com.sun.visage.jdi.FXWrapper
and com.sun.visage.jdi.FXVirtualMachine.

* FXObjectType, FXSequenceType represent com.sun.visage.runtime.FXObject
and com.sun.visage.runtime.sequence.Sequence types respectively.

* Command line debugger implementation is com.sun.visage.tools.debug.tty.TTY.
See also: src/com/sun/visage/tools/debug/README.

* com.sun.visage.tools.debug.tty.Debugger is programmatic interface to command
line debugger. This is currently used for testing - but it can be in futue.

* Testing:

The TestScaffold framework for platform JDI testing has been customized to test
FX-JDI. For a Java example, please refer to com.sun.visage.jdi.test.FramesTest.
Each FX-JDI test uses launching connector with a target/debugger program.
The target/debuggee sources are in com.sun.visage.jdi.test.target package.
For example, FramesTarget.java is the debuggee used by FramesTest.java. There
are also JavaFX examples. HelloTarget.visage, SequenceTarget.visage are target JavaFX
programs. Corresponding debugger tests are HelloTest.java and SequenceTest.java.
JavaFX debugger tests are derived from JavafxTestBase (which is derived from
TestScaffold). This takes care using visagert.jar in classpath of debuggee
and also using com.sun.visage.runtime.Main as the main class of the debuggee.

To run the tests, run:

    ant test
