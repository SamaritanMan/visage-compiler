This is under construction and is using a hacked up Animation class.

*** NOTE****
This should NOT be construed as the final way that animation will be
defined nor handled in JFX. 
*** NOTE****

The primary purpose of this package is to test other parts of the
JavaFX compiler project that will be impacted by animation. 
And to better understand the capabilities provided by the Scenario
animation classes.

Presently, there is an issue where the onMousePressed function
for the BlueButton cannot be set, so only the splash screen displays for now.
