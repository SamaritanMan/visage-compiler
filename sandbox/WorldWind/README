This project uses a JavaFX classes to front-end the NASA java Project
called WorldWind. (http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/index.html)

It is necessary to install the Java bindings for OpenGL (JOGL)
code for your hardware setup.  http://jogl.dev.java.net/

The "run.sh" script sets up the required command line to run this project.
In this script please set the variable: JOGL_HOME to point to the 
JOGL install directory for your environment.

Only known bug is that the JVM process does not completely exit
on Solaris Nevada x86. It is necessary to kill the process with 
kill -9. I have not tested on other environments.
