Open issues.

Binding, some binding is not working properly in the compiler
runtime, so there are some cases where binding has been commented out.
The most evident result of this is that the rulers at the top
and left of the display pane do not fully paint.

In the editor window, there is a problem with the compiler lexer
routine that if you type a left curly brace within a String, before typing the 
right curly brace, the lexer goes into an infinite loop. To avoid this,
type the right curly brace first.
