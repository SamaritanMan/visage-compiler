The JavaFX compiler extends the OpenJDK javac compiler.  While this
helps leverage the years of engineering effort put into javac, it 
means that debugging and profiling the JavaFX compiler is a little
difficult because the javac sources are external.

This project adds support so a developer can debug and profile the
JavaFX compiler using NetBeans.  Here are the steps:

1.  Download the OpenJDK source for JDK 7 build b17 (or at least its shared classes).
    The subversion repository for this build is located at 
    https://openjdk.dev.java.net/source/browse/openjdk/jdk/tags/jdk7-b17

2a. From the top-level directory (normally j2se/classes/src/share/classes),
    run:

        $ patch -p0 < {openjfx-compiler-root}/javac/javac-for-jfx.patch

                                -- OR --

2b. In NetBeans, open the Favorites panel, add {openjfx-compiler-root}
    as a favorite, and find the directory where the top-level packages
    (com, javax, etc.) are.  Right-click on that directory, run
    Tools->Apply Diff Patch.

3.  Define a "javac-sources" library in NetBeans, using 
    Tools->Library Manager.  

4.  Click the Add Jar/Folder button and specify the lib/javac.jar 
    file from your javafx-compiler source.  Click the Add Jar button.

5.  Click the Sources tab, then click the Add Jar/Folder button.
    Specify the j2se/src/share/classes directory in your local
    OpenJDK workspace.  Click the Add Jar button.

6.  Click OK to create the library.

7.  Right-click on the javac project and select Properties.  Click
    on the Libraries section.

8.  Click the Add Library button and add the javac-sources library.

9.  To debug or profile a JavaFX script, click on the Run section
    of the project's properties dialog.  In the arguments section,
    specify the path of the script.

NOTE:  this project does not build the javac compiler.  Refer to 
the OpenJDK documentation for information on how to build javac.
