Initalizing the Renamer:

The renamer is built on the classfile library of javac in the langtools repository, at the time of this writing the classfile is available with the latest
langtools version tag b70+. Until the main javac sources are brought upto
date with this we need a separate source base.

1. Similar to the previous step, copy in b70+ langtools repository, under 
   a directory called langtools
2. Invoke the ant script in the parent(javac) directory. 

Optionally the renamer can be built independently of javac directory,
for other usese by invoking the ant script in this directory
