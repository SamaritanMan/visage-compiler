/**
 * Provides a view of an underlying sequence by applying a mapping function to each element of the underlying
 * sequence. The mapping is done lazily, on each call to get(), rather than eagerly, so the time and space
 * construction costs of a MapSequence are O(1).  Mapped sequences should be constructed with the factory method
 * Sequences.map(), rather than with the MapSequence constructor.
