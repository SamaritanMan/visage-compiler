/**
 * Length units are meant for expressing screen layouts.
 * This includes both physical and relative measurements.
 * <p>
 * Physical measurements are expressed in terms of the size of the
 * final rendered version.  They are appropriate where the screen
 * characteristics are well known, but suffer from scaling issues where
 * the distance to the display varies greatly (such as cell phone vs. TV).
 * Supported measures include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Inches (mm)
 * <li>Centimeters (cm)
 * <li>Millimeters (mm)
 * <li>Points (pt)
 * <li>Picas (pc)
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Relative measurements are expressed in terms of other scaling factors such
 * as the font size, container size, or pixel density of the screen.
 * Supported measures include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Ems (em)
 * <li>Pixels (px)
 * <li>Density-independent pixels (dp)
 * <li>Scale-independent pixels (sp)
 * <li>Percentage (%)
 * </ul>
